    "The Ganges  is a trans-boundary river of Asia which flows through India and Bangladesh. The 2,525 km river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It flows south and east through the Gangetic plain of North India, receiving the right-bank tributary, the Yamuna, which also rises in the western Indian Himalayas, and several left-bank tributaries from Nepal that account for the bulk of its flow. In West Bengal state, India, a feeder canal taking off from its right bank diverts 50% of its flow southwards, artificially connecting it to the Hooghly River. The Ganges continues into Bangladesh, its name changing to the Padma. It is then joined by the Jamuna, the lower stream of the Brahmaputra, and eventually the Meghna, forming the major estuary of the Ganges Delta, and emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna system is the second-largest river on earth by discharge.",

    "Pollution of the Ganges, the largest river in the Indian subcontinent, poses significant threats to human health and the larger environment.[1] The river, which is severely polluted with human waste and industrial contaminants, provides water to about 40% of India's population across 11 states,[2] serving an estimated population of 500 million people, which is more than any other river in the world.Today, the Ganges is considered to be the fifth-most polluted river in the world.[5] An Indian photographer has noted that no one in India spoke of the Ganges as being polluted until the late 1970s.[6] However, pollution had been an old and continuous process in the river by the time people were finally acknowledging it. Stretches of over 600 km (370 mi) were essentially ecologically dead zones.[7]",
